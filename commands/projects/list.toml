The user wants to see all their Todoist projects.

Steps:
1. Call get_projects to retrieve all projects
2. Format output as a structured list showing:
   - Project name
   - Color indicator (emoji or text)
   - Whether it's a favorite (⭐)
   - View style (list/board)

Group projects by:
- Favorites first
- Then alphabetically or by order

Example output:
📁 Projects
├── ⭐ Work (blue, board view)
├── ⭐ Personal (green, list view)
├── Shopping (orange, list view)
└── Archive (grey, list view)
