The user wants to view their Todoist tasks.

Parse any filters from the input:
- --project NAME: filter by project name
- --priority N: filter by priority level (1-4)
- --label NAME: filter by label
- --filter QUERY: use Todoist filter syntax (today, overdue, p1, etc.)

If no filters specified, default to showing today's tasks.

Steps:
1. If --project specified, use get_projects to find the project ID
2. Call get_tasks with appropriate filters
3. Format output as a clear list:
   - [ ] Task name (Project) - due date
   - Show priority with colors/indicators

Common filters:
- "today" - tasks due today
- "overdue" - overdue tasks
- "p1" - priority 1 (urgent) tasks
- "no date" - tasks without due dates
